** How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? ** 

To ensure my software is functional, I use thorough unit testing, such as JUnit, to validate each component. I maintain high code coverage, like 100% for Contact.java, to ensure all edge cases are tested. 
Security is ensured through practices like input validation, checking for null values or invalid inputs in ContactService, and managing exceptions properly without hardcoding values or exposing sensitive information.

** How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  **

Interpreting user needs starts with defining functional and non-functional requirements. For instance, in the Contact service, user needs like restricting phone numbers to exactly 10 digits were implemented and verified through tests. 
Regular feedback from the client ensures the program aligns with expectations, and continuous iteration guarantees that the software evolves as requirements change.

** How do I approach designing software?  **

I approach software design by breaking down projects into smaller, manageable modules, ensuring that each component follows principles like SOLID. 
For example, in ContactService, I focused on encapsulation and reusability, ensuring clear separation of concerns. I prioritize writing maintainable, testable code by integrating unit tests early in development to catch errors and make the software scalable and robust.
